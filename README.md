guide your friend home who only knows how to walk forward! use the environment to get him to the flag!

this game was made by myself in 12 hours for the above game jam! it was the first game jam I ever participated in and I learned a lot from it, about myself, about godot, about how NOT to do a game jam, et cetera!
